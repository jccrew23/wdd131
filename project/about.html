            <h2>Why us?</h2>
            <p>To keep things simply, I believe music is to be enjoyed. It is a BLESSING to make and enjoy music and being able to share that with others through teaching feels like "teaching a man to fish". Music should be expressive and fun, and a choice to enjoy. I highly encourage support from parents for daily practice, and I make sure there are weekly practice assignments as this fosters the most effective progress. <br>Bi-yearly performance opportunities are available and participation is highly encouraged. We want to show off your progress!</p>

            <p>My name is Jalielle Curtis. I am a avid music lover and a mother. I have trained in piano performance since 2007, when I was 8 years old. I have been teaching in the Roanoke area since 2022 and have experience teaching all ages in other fields as well since 2013. I absolutely love creating emotional, beautiful music and, even more, I love teaching others to understand music and learn to love it too! I would love to be able to meet you and your family and bring music into your home. </p>
